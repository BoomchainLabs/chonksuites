# Replit Project Documentation

## Overview

This is a full-stack Web3 loyalty dashboard called "Chonk9k Suite" built with React, TypeScript, and Express.js. It implements a gamified rewards system with dual-chain wallet integration supporting both Base (EVM) and Solana networks. Users earn $LERF tokens (Base Chain) and $CHONK9K tokens (Solana) for completing daily tasks, referrals, and loyalty activities. The platform features a Nintendo-style gaming aesthetic with comprehensive Web3 CLI tools for real blockchain operations.
